** was_tracer

This gem allows you to parse IBM's Websphere Application Server trace files
containing methods entries and exits and outputs a set of HTML files that allows
you to navigate through a recreated call stack highlighting possible
bottlenecks.

** Usage

* Gem:

$ gem install was_tracer
$ was_tracer <output name> <trace file>

* From source:

$ git clone git://github.com/cezarsa/was_tracer.git

A directory named <output name> will be created, just open the file named
<output name>_main.html in your browser and rejoice!
